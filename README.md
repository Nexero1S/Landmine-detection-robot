# Landmine-detection-robot
Landmine Detection Bot uses a metal sensor to detect landmines and 
promptly alerts the user through a buzzer .The device is fully remote-controlled, 
enabling users to navigate the bot with precision in specific patterns from a safe 
distance,ensuring user safety.The devices used for this project are:Arduino uno, L298 Motor driver, TransmitterReceiver,Direct Current(DC) motors,
Jumper wires,Diode Capacitor , Resistor , Ultrasonic Sensor,Node MCU ,Breadboard,Software Resources
